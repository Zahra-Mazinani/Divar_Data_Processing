# Data_Divar
This project is about data analysis and I tried to make a model that recognizes if a request in the https://divar.ir/ about a car is valid or not.
this project prepared for divar [competition](https://aaic.aut.ac.ir/competition/6) that organized by amirkabir university of tecnology.

Because of the volume of data I used Pyspark library to preprocess data.
for the model I used gradient boosted tree algorithm, using  CatBoost library. (it is more accurate than XGBoost library)
